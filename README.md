# Halite AI Bot: *Lord of the Stump*

**Lord of the Stump** is an AI swarm bot that was used in the AI Challenge at Halite.io. The objective is to battle other AIs and the winner is raised up in the ranks. When I was developing this final iteration. I was ranked ~55 out of 1100 people. A couple months later when the competition concluded Lord of the Stump was still rank 145. See gif below for an example game feature this bot.

## Notes

Props to the Halite team who put this on. I really enjoyed it. 

When developing the AI, if must only issue commands to each block based on the information it has. Unless you program it, you cannot simply tell all the blocks to move a certain way. Each block must be controlled individually.
